FrontEnd for "TaskPro" project

Description: It's final team project after completing the FullStack developer
course of GoIT. Our task was to create a WEB application from scratch. For
FrontEnd we used React. The project was implemented according to the layout. The
MobileFirst approach, responsive and adaptive layout is used. There are private
and public application pages. The user interface consists of: Header, Sidebar
and ScreensPage. The user has the opportunity to edit his personal data and
download an Avatar separately, choose one of the three visual themes of the
application. In the Sidebar, it is possible to create, select, edit and delete a
Board, request help and exit the application. In Board, we create columns and
cards with tasks or notes. User can edit cards, sort by priority, set Deadline,
drag to another columns and delete.
